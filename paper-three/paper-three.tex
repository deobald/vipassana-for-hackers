Anyone curious about Vipassana

Anyone who has never meditated before but would like to learn

Anyone who is wondering why people keep talking about Vipassana

\begin{itemize}
  \item posture
  \item sleep
  \item health (activation / motivation)
  \item ethics (activation / motivation)
  \item your children: a. knowing how to meditate, b. cross-legged posture
  \item emotion (i.e. anger)
  \item mundane sphere / productivity (21 lessons, seinfeld)
  \item reset frame of reference outside oneself, outside one's own lifetime: ``trees for god'' and obvious karma (sidu/booga smoking)
  \item unlearning obsessive / repetitive thought, enhancing creativity
  \item controlling unbounded sexuality without repression
  \item clarity: in thought, work, planning
  \item clarification: ``isn't that what makes us human?'' (emotions) --- rather, what makes us animal
  \item Die Standing Up

\end{itemize}
